# 🔐 Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

An end-to-end **Machine Learning–based Network Intrusion Detection System** that analyzes network traffic to identify malicious activities and potential cyber threats. This project focuses on data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model training to classify normal vs. attack traffic effectively.
